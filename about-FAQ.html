          <h1>ABOUT</h1>
          <p>We are an organization that strives in connecting people in Portland to food pantries, free meals and urban foraging opportunities. Believing in that everyone deserves access to local, fresh and healthy produce, we wanted to create an easy to use website to inform people of where they can obtain these useful services. Free Food Finder launched in April of 2019 by a team of four students at Epicodus.</p>
