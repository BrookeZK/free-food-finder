## Description
_This is a website that helps users easily locate free food-pantries and meals across Portland, OR. As such, we call it "Free Food Finder PDX" (FFF-PDX). The landing page displays the FFF-PDX logo, a menu bar and a display that shows the free grocery and meal events of the day, a quick about-us blurb, and a notice about the fruit and vegetables that are currently in season within the area. The menu bar allows the user to navigate to through the five FFF-PDX webpages: about page, resources page, calendar page, map page, and a link back to the homepage._

_The about page provides details about FFF-PDX, including a mission statement, a how-to/FAQ, contact information, and links to social media._

_The resources page provides information about further resources to our users: a link to Portland's public transit, Trimet, for planning your trip; a link to the Oregon Food Bank, Oregon's largest nonprofit free food distributor and organizer; a link to Portland's Multnomah county government website that details government food programs; a link to summer meals, a program specifically for kids up to 18 years old that provides a combination of breakfast, lunch, snacks and supper meals; and finally, a link to Falling Fruit, a crowd-sourced world-wide website that pins fruit trees on a map so that people that forage for free food around their town._   

_The calendar page and the map page showcase the two ways that we provide information from our database of free food locations: (1) organized and color-coded on an embeded google calendar, listing events by the date and time that they occur, and (2) organized by location in a map of Portland, implementing the googlemaps API to visually display our database of free food locations with extensive details about each location._

_We are not the only food locator out there, but we are proud of the dynamic way of searching for and displaying the vast array of free food locations available. We hope to make a tangible difference in the lives of Portlanders, and continue to refine this site to be in greater service to the community._
